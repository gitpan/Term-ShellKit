=head1 TO DO

It would be nice to confirm that we can cleanly separate out CPAN::Shell in a way that does not substantially alter its features.


=head2 Terminal I/O Niceties

Save command history.

Perhaps improve the tab-ahead function.

It would be good to support batches of multiple shell commands separated by semicolons.


=head2 Input Modes

=over 4

=item *

Finish restoring LineBuffer code to support trailing-\ and << formats.

=item *

Add support for batch-buffered input, like DBI shell. Keep appending until /go; also allow /clear, /quit, /edit.

=head2 Command Kits

System kit:

  execute
  alias ! execute
  
  alias pwd ! pwd
  alias ls ! ls
  alias more ! more
  alias grep ! grep
  sub cd ($) { chdir( shift ) }
  
  Also add a direct-to-system pass-through mode... ?

Textfile kit:

  show_file
  find_text
  replace_text


=head1 BUGS

If there's a syntax error in a module when you re-read it with the "reload" command, it's often not re-read the next time you run reload. Running reload one more time should fix this problem.
